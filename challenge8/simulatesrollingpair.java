/*
Write a program that simulates rolling a pair of dice. Roll of 1st die will give a number between 1 and
6. Roll of 2nd die will also give a number between 1 and 6. You can use java.security.SecureRandom
class to get the numbers for both the dice. Their sum can be number between 2 and 12.
At the start ask the user to guess a number between 2 and 12. Then roll both the dice and if their
sum matches with the guessed number then we have a winner. Display greetings and exit the
program.
But if their sum doesnâ€™t match, then ask user, if he would like to play again. If his answer is n, then
exit the program but if his answer is y then re-run the same logic.
Your output should match with below output
